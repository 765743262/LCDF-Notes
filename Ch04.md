# Chapter 4: Arithmetic Functions and HDLs

Arithmetic blocks are functional block that perform arithmetic operations.

## 4-1 Iterative Combinational Circuits

There is an special **hierarchical circtuit** called **iterative array**. It performs a function that requires many same subfunctions. The subfunction blocks are referred to as **cells** and the overall implementation is called an **array of cells.** 

There will often be **connnections between adjacent cells** to pass values.

Arithmetic blocks are typically design to operate on **binary input vectors and produce binary output vectors.** That means the same subfunction can be applied to each bit position, with connections passing value between adjacent bit positions.

Generally, an iterative array that operates one two $n$-input vectors and produces an $n$-output vector is as following:

Note how this inputs and outputs are indexed. **These are indexed according to the first cell**. For example, $C_0$ are indexed $0$ but $X_1, Y_1$ are indexed $1$.

## 4-2 Binary Adders

* A **half adder** is combinational circuit that performs the addition of **two bits**.
  * Inputs: $X$, $Y$
  * Outpus: $C$, $S$
* A **full adder** is performs the addition of **three bits**
  * Inputs: $X, Y, Z$
  * Outputs: $C, S$.

The names of the circuits stem from the fact that **two half adders can be imployed to implement a full adder**.

### Half Adder

A half adder generates the **arithmetic sum** of **two bits**. The inputs and outputs are $X, Y, C, S$. This is based on:
$$
0 + 0 = 0\\
0 + 1 = 1\\
1 + 0 = 1\\
1 + 1 = 11
$$
Note only the last one generates a carry. It can be implemented with an **exclusive OR** and a **AND** gate.
$$
S = X \oplus Y\\
C = XY
$$

### Full Adder

A full adder is a combinational circuit that performs the **arithmetic sum of three input bits.** Inputs and outputs are $X, Y, Z, C, S$, where $Z$ represents **the carry from the previous lower significant position**.

![T4-2](Pics/T4-2.png)

Note that the function for $S$ is an **odd function**. And $C = 1$ if and only if **two or more input bits are $1$.**
$$
S = X\oplus Y \oplus Z\\
C = XY + Z(X\oplus Y)
$$
Note the equation for $C$ means: $X$ are $Y$ are both $1$, otherwise one of them is one and $Z$ is one.

**What it actually does is**:

* Find the sum and carry $S_0, C_0$of $X$ and $Y$
* Find the sum and carry $S_1, C_1$ of $S_0$ and $Z$
* The final sum is $S_1$, the final carry is $C_0 + C_1$.

It's amazing that the logic diagram follows from these equations are exactly **two half adder plus an OR gate.**

To draw this, first draw two half adders, and then connect the right line.

### Binary Ripple Carry Adder

An **$n$-bit parallel binary adder**, or an **$n$-bit ripple carry adder**, consists of **EXACTLY** $n$ full adders, with **each output carry connected to the input carry of the next-higher-order full adder**.

* Inputs: $A[n-1, 0], B[n-1, 0], C_0$
* Outpus: $S[n -1, 0], C_n$

Note how each inputs and outputs are indexed.

## 4-3 Binary Subtraction

Subtraction of **unsigned binary numbers has two inputs and two outputs.**

* Minuend: $M$
* Subtrahend: $N$
* Magnitude of the difference: $D$
* Sign

**If minus sign is needed in the final result, it must be stored separately from the $n$-bit result.**

The most important thing is to find the magnitude. An inefficient method is to compare the subtrahend and the minuend. An alternative is:

1. Subtruct $N$ from $M$
2. If no **end borrow occurs**, then $M \geq N$, the result is **positive** and correct.
3. If an **end borrow occurs**, then $M < N$. **Take the 2's complement of the result.** 

In this case that there's borrow into the most significant bit, the result is $M - N + 2^n$, and should subtruce from $2^n$ to get $N - M$, with a minus sign.

Subtraction of a binary number from $2^n$ is called **taking the 2's complement of the number**.

Now an adder-subtractor can be built as

### Complements

In a **base-$r$ system**, there are two types of complement:

- The _radix complement_: **r's complement**
- The _diminished radix complement: **(r - 1)'s complement**

**Given a number $N$ of $n$ digits,**

$(r - 1)$'s complement is
$$
(2^n - 1) - N
$$
$r$'s complement is
$$
2^n - N
$$
The $(r-1)$'s complement is basicly subtracing each digit from $2^n$. 

**$r$'s complement of $N$ can be obtained by adding $1$ to $(r-1)$'s complement of $N$**.

The $2$'s complement can also be formed by leaving all least significant $0$'s and the first $1$ unchanged and the replacing $1$s with $0$s and $0$s with $1$s in all other higher significant bits.

### Subtraction Using $2s Complement

Note in previous method for implementing an adder-subtractor, we need

* An adder
* An subtractor
* A $2$'s complementer

In this implementation, we need

* An adder
* Two $2$'s complementers

**In essence, we perform**
$$
2^n + (M - N)
$$
And note this is equal to 
$$
M + (2^n - N)
$$


Thus the procedure is

1. Add the $2$'s complement of **the subtrahend $N$** to the minuend $M$. This performs $M + (2^n - N) = M - N + 2^n$.
2. If $M \ge N$, the sum produces an **end carry**. Dicard the carry.
3. If $M < N$, the sum does not produce an end carry. Then **Take the $2$'s complement of the sum** and placing a minus sign in front.

### 4-4 Binary Adder-Subtractors

Some facts:

* Selective $1$'s complement can be easily implemented with **XOR gates** with selection inputs.
* $M$ plus the $2$'s complement of $N$ equals $M + 1$ plus $1$'s complement of  $N$.

Now here comes the new adder-subtractor, (without the final correction)

![F4-7](Pics/F4-7.png)

**The amazing part is, we ingeniously make use the originally unused input carry, and connect it with the selective input.**

![E4-1](Pics/E4-1.jpeg)

**The correction operation is performed by using either the adder-subtractor a second time with $M = 0$ or a selective complementer.**
