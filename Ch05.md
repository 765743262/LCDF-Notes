# Sequential Circuits

## 5-1 Sequential circuit definition

* A **sequential circuit** consists of:

  * A combinatorial circuit
  * Storage elements
  
* **State**:

  the binary information stored in the storage elements

* Functions in sequential circuit:

  Inputs + present state -> outputs + next state

* Two types of sequential circuits:

  * Synchronous sequential circuit
  
    Depends on signals at discrete instants of time.
  
  * Asybchronous sequential circuits:
  
    Depends on inputs at any instants of time
